## MySQL too many connections issue

- Kill mysql processes with Activity Monitor (maybe restart computer too, or at least local MAMP server)
- Console into: mysql -u root
- > show variables like "max_connections";
- > set global max_connections = 500;

## Notes for Laravel Scheduler + AWS SQS (WIP)

Laravel Scheduler (with local CRON) working. Currently it just calls DeleteInActiveUsers:deleteusers (which just updates my contact id:5 on the updated_at field). We can use this as a template to create other functions.

- Sessions, Cache and Queue needed to be created for auto-scaling. Works locally now too so that's fine.
- Need to edit Cron for local scheduling: 1) Edit the Cron file $ crontab -e 2) * * * * * php /path/to/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

- Good article on scaling Laravel with AWS Elastic Beanstalk (https://deliciousbrains.com/scaling-laravel-aws-elastic-beanstalk-part-1-setting-up-laravel/)
- Another good article about AWS EB + laravel-aws-worker package (https://blog.menara.com.au/2016/06/running-laravel-in-amazon-elastic-beanstalk/)


## Notes for Laravel Queues for taking email sends out of the flow

The difference between Laravel Scheduler and Laravel Queues >> Scheduler is more for timed/recurring functions rather than Queues which are tasks/jobs added to a queue for later (attributed to a user).

- Needed to create new queue table for queued jobs using $ php artisan queue:table
- And another for failed jobs using $ php artisan queue:failed-table
- Run command to create jobs db tables but done from migrations/jobs subfolder $ php artisan migrate --path=/database/migrations/jobs/
- Add or Edit QUEUE_DRIVER=database in env file
- Added new test queue job $ php artisan make:job SubmissionThanks
- Updated App\Jobs\SubmissionThanks file to execute SubmissionThanks mail (WIP)
- Then we have to create a schedule function to keep checking the queue.
- Run $ php artisan queue:listen

## Notes for GAE setup

I have added Sessions, Cache and Queue + add a GAE specific packages and created app.yaml file. Then deployed to GAE Flex for testing.

- Added packages to composer:

"google/cloud-tools":"^0.6"
"google/cloud-storage": "^1.0",

- Added script to composer:

"post-install-cmd": [
    "chmod -R 755 bootstrap\/cache",
    "php artisan cache:clear"
]

- Added app.yaml file. Pay attention to specific GAE variables like GOOGLE_BUCKET_NAME, DB_SOCKET, liveness_check, and beta_settings. Plus, your APP_KEY must match for your local project before deploying (check with $ php artisan key:generate).


- Added warm up using liveness_check which keeps servers live longer so they don't suspend and become slow on initial requests during slow periods. Note that warm up is different on GAE Flex from GAE Standard. More info here (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml)


## Side hustle for a way to check if Unilad cache is down

Working on a way to automatically check if Unilad Cloudflare cache is down (via Laravel Scheduler + CUrl).
