Then burn the .iso to a DVD or use UNetbootin to install the .iso on a USB flash drive. Boot your computer using the DVD or USB flash drive to run Pentoo. Once Pentoo is running, type startx at the command line to launch the desktop environment. Accept the \"default config\" in the first dialog box and then launch a Terminal Emulator window using the icon at the bottom of the screen. At the time of writing, the current Pentoo .iso (2014.0-RC3) has a minor bug that you need to work around by typing \"eselect lapack set 1\" at the command line in the terminal window before trying to use GNU Radio. You only need to do this once after starting up Pentoo, but you\'ll have to do it every time you boot an unmodified .iso. To verify that your HackRF is detected, type \"hackrf_info\" at the command line. It should produce a few lines of output including \"Found HackRF board.\" The 3V3, 1V8, RF, and USB LEDs should all be illuminated and are various colors. Now you can use programs such as gnuradio-companion or gqrx to start experimenting with your HackRF.

Encountering a chalkboard inscribed with the countless given names of various children, she includes her own name. Before continuing her stroll, where she is suddenly captivated by a toy store overflowing with dolls across from the chalkboard. Taking notice of a doll physically identical to her through a window that resembles the mouth of a monster, she tries to enter the vacant, deserted, silent shop to retrieve the toy for herself. But the front door is locked. After giving up trying to open it, Alma begins to walk away, only for the door to mysteriously open. She returns and enters the store.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: right; margin-left: 20px;\" title=\"Alma\" src=\"/content/uploads/images/January2015/FILE-20150103-16126JMX6QC73F42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"251\" />Alma tries to retrieve the doll but nearly steps on a small toy boy riding a bike who tries to escape but the door closes in front of him. As Alma starts to climb a shelf the doll somehow moved to, the eyes of the other children dolls suddenly start moving and watching her. While trying to snatch it off of the shelf, the moment she touches it a fast sequence of various brief, quick clips of petrifying footage flashes across the screen before suddenly taking focus on the entire shop from Alma\'s perspective on the shelf-top.</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards, it is revealed that Alma\'s inner consciousness has somehow been withdrawn from her body into that of the doll resembling her. As all of the other dolls sitting atop the shelf suddenly roll their eyes, focusing on her (in revelation of the dark, true intentions of that particular store), a different doll is raised to the shop window bearing resemblance to another child, implying that the cycle will continue on another victim.</p>','Alma is a short film produced by ex-Pixar animator Rodrigo Blaas.

	(47,'licensed',1,27,19,'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles','file','subscriber','<p>April O\'Neil is a news reporter for Channel 6 Eyewitness News in New York City investigating a crime wave by a clan of thieves called the Foot Clan. After her latest lead; a dock worker, refuses to give her information, she returns to the dock at night only to witness the Foot raiding the cargo containers. They are attacked by an unseen vigilante, which April fails to capture on her phone\'s camera but notices a symbol left behind. However, April\'s supervisor Bernadette Thompson and her co-workers are oblivious to her beliefs of the vigilante\'s existence. At a charity event she is covering for the company Sacks Industries, she expresses her gratitude to her father\'s lab partner before he died, Eric Sacks.</p>\r\n<p>Frustrated by the vigilante, the Foot Clan\'s leader Shredder has them hold a subway station of people hostage in order to draw him out. April goes to the scene, for evidence but ends up becoming a hostage herself. The lights go out, and four figures appear to face the clan, taking them out and freeing the hostages. April tracks them to a rooftop, and manages to take their picture, but she passes out when she is confronted with four anthropomorphic mutant turtles. When she comes to, she finds that they had wiped her phone and advise her not to tell anyone of them before leaving. As they leave, she manages to hear Raphael and Leonardo\'s names. She returns to her apartment and remembers a project her father was working on in 1999; \"Project Renaissance\" involving four turtles named Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and a rat she called Splinter. Unable to convince Bernadette of the turtles\' existence, April is dismissed. April has her coworker Vern Fenwick drive her out to Eric Sacks\' estate where she confides in him about what she has discovered. Eric believes her and reveals that he hopes they can unlock the secrets of a mutagen they had been experimenting with to cure disease in the populace thought lost in the fire.</p>\r\n<p>Punishing them for venturing to the surface, Splinter goads Mikey into revealing they met April, and he demands to have her meet them. When they bring her to their sewer lair, Splinter explains that April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewers. The mutagen being experimented upon them caused the five of them to grow into more humanoid attributes, and Splinter took on the role of their father, using April\'s father as an example. After finding a book on Ninjitsu in a storm drain, he proceeded to teach himself, then the turtles in the fighting style. April reveals that she told Sacks, whom Splinter says betrayed her father and killed him, just then, the Foot attacks. They fight valiantly until Shredder arrives, who defeats Splinter as he is trying to keep his turtles from entering a fight with Shredder, knowing Shredder is a far superior warrior than the four mutants. A series of explosives bury Raph in rubble while the other turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raph decide they need to save the others. Finally convincing Vern of the turtles\' existence, he drives them to Sacks\' estate and break in as the others are being drained of their blood in order to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks hopes to flood New York with, in order to become rich from all the people seeking his cure. Raph is beaten down by Shredder while April and Vern free the others by injecting them with adrenaline. They escape the compound in pursuit of Sacks, but are followed by heavy machines and trucks. The group manages to survive the onslaught through teamwork, though Vern\'s van is destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>In the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device on a high radio tower to flood the city. April and Vern face Sacks in the lab, while the turtles fight Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the support for the tower collapses and the turtles try to hold it up and keep it from falling and infecting the city. April arrives and confronts Shredder with the mutagen, in the struggle, the tower collapses and the turtles pull April onto it with them as Shredder falls to the streets. Believing they\'re about to be destroyed, the turtles confess their innermost secrets, Raph gives an impassioned speech of his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover.</p>\r\n<p>Sometime later, April meets with Vern who has a new loaner car from the news station, he tries and fails once again to ask April out on a date. The turtles appear in a special modified \"Turtle Van\" and Mikey accidentally blows up Vern\'s new car with a rocket. As the police respond to the explosion, the turtles leave, but not before Mikey tries to serenade April with \"Happy Together\".</p>','Something something shredder',1,0,60,33,'February2015/tmnt.jpg',NULL,NULL,NULL,'','https://s3.amazonaws.com/hellovideo/demo-site/videos/tmnt.mp4',NULL,'','2013-12-01','In the sewer',NULL,1,'2017-11-29 15:05:17','LhOjwIIGbV2q5Izkg3SH2nMf1M0xDY',NULL,1,0,NULL,1,NULL,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2017-11-29 15:59:27','2015-02-26 02:06:05'),
